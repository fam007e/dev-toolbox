# Org Research Tool

The Org Research tool allows you to gather information about a public GitHub organization. You can view a list of their public repositories, see a breakdown of the programming languages used across all of their projects, and get an overview of the software licenses they use.

## How to Use

1.  **Enter the GitHub organization name** in the input field.
2.  Press **Enter** to fetch the data.
3.  The tool will display three panels:
    *   **Repositories:** A list of the organization's public repositories.
    *   **Languages:** A chart showing the distribution of programming languages.
    *   **Licenses:** A list of the licenses used in the organization's repositories.

### Keybindings

-   `Ctrl+A`: Toggle "Allow No Parent" option.
-   `Ctrl+E`: Export current results to a JSON file.
