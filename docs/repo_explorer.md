# Repo Explorer Tool

The Repo Explorer tool allows you to explore the contents of a public GitHub repository. You can view a list of files and directories, see the contents of a file, and get a breakdown of the programming languages used in the repository.

## How to Use

1.  **Enter the GitHub repository URL** in the format `owner/repo` (e.g., `facebook/react`).
2.  Press **Enter** to fetch the data.
3.  The tool will display two panels:
    *   **Files:** A list of the files and directories in the repository.
    *   **Languages:** A chart showing the distribution of programming languages.
4.  You can navigate the file list using the **arrow keys** and press **Enter** to view the contents of a file.

### Keybindings
